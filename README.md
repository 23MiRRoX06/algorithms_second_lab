# Second algorithms lab

Command-line application for second algorithms lab with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`. Uses quick sort algorithm to sort an array and two-pointers 
algorithm to find pair of integers.

## Task

There is an array of N integer and the number P. Can there be three (only three) integers Ai Aj Ak (i ≠ j ≠ k) 
in an array whose sum is equal to the number P (Ai + Aj + Ak = P)?

Constraints: 

3 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 10^9	where 1 <= i <= N
1 <= P <= 3 * 10^9
